 Question 1

 'let', 'const', and 'var' are used to declare variables in javascript.

 * 'let' - is use to declare variables that can be reassigned
 * 'const' - is use to declare variables that should not be reassigned
 * 'var' - is use to declare variables that can be reassigned but due to it hoisting behavior it can cause unexpected bugs in your application.

 Question 2

We can use a variable after it has been defined by referencing its name in your code.
After declaring a variable you can access its value.
-Example-
let newVariable = 10; //variable declaration
let outCome = newVariable + 10; //using the variable in an operation
console.log(outCome) // outPut: 20

Question 3

We can declare a string by enclosing characters within single quotes (') or double quotes (")
-Example-
let myString1 = "Welcome to javascript";
let myString2 = 'Hello World!';
let myString3 = '25';

Question 4

Yes, both single quotes and double quotes can be used interchangeably to create strings 
but it is your personal preference to choose one of them.
And it also adviced to choose one quote style in your code for consistency.

Question 5

"9" - because 9 is ecnlosed in quotes, its datatype becomes a string.
9 - 9 is not ecnlosed in quotes, therefore its datatype is an integer or number.

Question 6

* Declaration - is the act of introducing a new variable or identifier. 
It done by using the following keywords; let , var and const.
-Example-
let newVariable;

* Redeclaration - is the act of declaring a variable again within the same scope.
-Example-
let newVariable = 2; // declaration
let newVariable = 4; // Redeclaration

* Assignment - refers to assigning a value to a variable, it involves using the '=' assignment operator.
-Example-
let newVariable = 5; // assigning a value 5 to a variable 'newVariable'

* Reassignment - refers to the act of changing the value of an existing variable.
-Example-
let myVariable = 10; // assignment
let newVariable = 15; // reassignment
